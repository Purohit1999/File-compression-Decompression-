# 📦 File Compression & Decompression Program

This Java program demonstrates how to compress and decompress files using Java's built-in utilities, specifically the `DeflaterOutputStream` and `InflaterInputStream` classes. It provides a simple yet effective way to reduce file sizes for storage or transfer, as well as restore compressed files back to their original form. 🚀

---

## 💡 Features
- **Compression**: Efficiently compress files using the `DeflaterOutputStream` class.
- **Decompression**: Restore compressed files to their original state using the `InflaterInputStream` class.
- Modular and reusable code structure for easier maintenance.
- Includes proper error handling and logging for reliability.

## ⚙️ Compression and Decompression Details

### 🗜️ Compression
The program reads a file from the specified input path, compresses its contents using `DeflaterOutputStream`, and writes the compressed data to a new file. Ideal for reducing file size before storage or transfer.

Example paths:
- **Input File**: `D:\\ExampleDirectory\\logo.jpg`
- **Compressed File**: `D:\\ExampleDirectory\\compressedLogo.txt`

### 🔓 Decompression
The program reads a compressed file using `InflaterInputStream`, decompresses its contents, and writes the original data to a new file. This restores the file to its original state.

Example paths:
- **Compressed File**: `D:\\ExampleDirectory\\compressedLogo.txt`
- **Decompressed File**: `D:\\ExampleDirectory\\decompressedLogo.jpg`

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- A basic understanding of file paths and permissions.
